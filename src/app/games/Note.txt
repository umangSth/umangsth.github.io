command:  wasm-pack build --target web

2025-04-16
Beginning of the games implementation, with wasm support

started with the hello-wasm, which is a simple reverse function
main dependencies: wasm-bindgen and lib crate-type
complied with wasm-pack build --target web

no errors, so far!


2025-04-17

changing the hello-wasm to use canvas to draw a simple circle or Rectangle
where we use the wasm_bindgen to bridge rust and js, and web_sys to interact with the DOM and canvas APIs.
the get_context function is used to get the 2d context of the canvas, and 
the draw_circle and draw_rect functions are used to draw a circle or rectangle on the canvas.
and the lib crate-type to compile the wasm file, which is then imported in the next.js project.
